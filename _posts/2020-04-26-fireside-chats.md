title: Fireside chats - winning hackathons and meeting an ER doctor
---

We have had some awesome talks done by these experts recently:
* Q and A with doctor/developer/designer Dr. Vincent Dumouchel
* "How to Win a Hackathon" by Ben Zittlau

## Q and A with doctor/developer/designer

Dr. Vincent Dumouchel shared a lot with us about his career path through school, bootcamps, part time as an ER doctor, and director of a tech agency. We started talking about the difference between being on an ER team (think commanding and getting things done fast) versus a technology team (think good communication and talking things through). Then, we heard about the urgent need for waiting room patient monitoring in Canadian hospitals. People can sometimes walk in and appear okay but have their conditions rapidly worsen and end up in ICU. 

The chat concluded with a discussion about what makes a good leader, whether at a company or on a hackathon team. Vincent mentioned: 

>A leader is someone who makes space for everyone to talk. You need a leader on a hackathon team to organize everything and make sure everyone’s voice is heard. 

After the session was over, everyone commented on how comforting it was to be able to talk one another about what we are going through. Vincent said it was important to **"take time to speak about your feelings"**.

## "How to Win a Hackathon" by Ben Zittlau
Ben gave us awesome tips on how to make the best of a Hackathon. See his slides [here](https://tinyurl.com/how-to-win-a-hackathon). One piece of encouragement Ben gave us is to **"Use this opportunity to practice.  Don’t wait until you believe you have the best project you’ve ever done to do your first submission."** Hackathons can be for fun and even if your project isn't "finished" take some time to try to submit for fun anyways! You never know, judges could love it.
