We are so proud of our leader Mark Bennett for talking on the Radio way back on March 16th when this thing all started! Read about the interview [here](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-programmers-hosting-virtual-covid-19-hackathon-1.5499553).

We also we featured on Global Edmonton to explain a little bit about what a hackathon is! Even one of our weekly winners Blake Prouty from [Charity Shop Exchange](2020/04/07/charity-shop-exchange.html) was able to share some insights.
